## About Me
I currently work as a Senior Lecturer at the Department of Computer Science, University of Jos - Nigeria.

## Research Interests

- I am interested in data mining and Machine Learning, particularly in the application to Health and distributed systems. In my PhD research, I studied utilizing an Unsupervised Machine learning method for detecting errors that lead to failures in HPC systems. These errors are rare events, therefore it was treated as an anomaly detection problem. Currently, I am looking at the application of Machine Learning in health care. One of my works is in the area of exploring transfer learning in predicting cervical cancer from pap smear images. Similarly, I am working with other researchers on utilizing machine learning to predict Cardiovascular disease risk levels in people with no symptoms.
Particularly, the work looks at the possibility of using non-lab test variables (non-invasive risk factors) in predicting
risk level.
Going forward, I want to look into how medical data can influence the performance of Machine learning /Deep Learning algorithms. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms/architectures have performed excellently in different domains. A lot of research has been done on improving their performances. However, at the centre of the performance of these algorithms is data. Having high-quality data that works well is as important as building a good model if not more. Such data are either unavailable or not in good shape to be used or even the data collection processes cannot guarantee quality. I want to look at data-centric approaches to improving the performances of Machine Learning models. I am also interested in economics and computation. In this, I am interested in looking at how Machine learning and algorithms can be utilized for economic issues and /or economic policies.
