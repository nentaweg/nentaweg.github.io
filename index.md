## About Me
I currently work as a Senior Lecturer at the Department of Computer Science, University of Jos - Nigeria. I hold a PhD from the University of Warwick in Coventry, United Kingdom, an MSc from the African University of Science and Technology in Abuja, and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Jos.<br>
I am an active member of esteemed professional organizations. Since 2013, I have been a proud IEEE member, contributing to and staying abreast of cutting-edge advancements in technology. A recent addition to my affiliations is the ACM, where I've been a member since 2020, further connecting with the global community of computing professionals. Additionally, since 2017, I have been an esteemed member of the Nigerian Computer Society (NCS), contributing to the local computer science landscape.

## Research Interests

- In my PhD research was themed on data mining and Machine Learning with a specific focus on its application in distributed systems. My primary investigation revolved around employing Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques to detect errors leading to failures in High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. Since these errors were infrequent occurrences, I treated the problem as an anomaly detection challenge.

- Currently, my research has extended into the field of healthcare, where I have explored the application of Machine Learning. One notable project involves the utilization of transfer learning for predicting cervical cancer from pap smear images. Additionally, I am collaborating with fellow researchers on using machine learning to predict Cardiovascular disease risk levels in asymptomatic individuals. Specifically, we are investigating the feasibility of leveraging non-laboratory test variables, such as non-invasive risk factors, for predicting risk levels.

- Looking ahead, my focus is on understanding how medical data quality can significantly impact the performance of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. While these algorithms have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse domains, the pivotal role of high-quality data cannot be overstated. Often, such data is either unavailable, in suboptimal condition for use, or the data collection processes lack assurances of quality. Therefore, I aim to explore data-centric approaches to enhance the effectiveness of Machine Learning models.

- My interests also extend to the intersection of economics and computation. I am particularly intrigued by the potential applications of Machine Learning and algorithms in addressing economic issues and shaping economic policies. This involves a nuanced exploration of how these technological tools can be harnessed to contribute meaningfully to economic analyses and decision-making processes.
